# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 4: October 11, 2019, Friday 12:38AM

***Progress*** Okay so I'm not great at updating this thing. I've technically been doing code stuff in between day 3 and 4 but whatever, lol. School is still focused on HTML, so I've been brushing up. Also sticking with git for various tasks so I can get used to it. On Tuesday there was a meetup about digital Ethnography led by a Sr User Researcher at Amazon, my sloppy notes for that will be attached below in lieu of links, so if you're interested at all check that out. Today, I worked on the general structural layout of an HTML page. I have lots of homework to do tomorrow, I've been distracted today with opting out of websites that post my personal information (not an easy task!).

***Thoughts*** I am tired. 

***Notes from the Meetup***

Meetup Sr. User Researcher Beth Kelley 10/8/19 Notes
Digital Ethnography

Study of systematic recording of human cultures

Digital ethnography = Data gathering                                                       methods mediated by computer mediated comm or digital technologies

A human relationship with tech, online communities.

Digital identities.

People want their opinions and expressions to validate them. 

Good for understanding place within the world, usability, unearthing important user issues, cultural trends, sentiment and perceptions, feedback. New user cases.

Stress testing products and services.

Stakeholders, colleagues, internal external. Look at competitors’ reviews. Knowing the  audience of the specific social network. Collecting data from low level employees,. What’s real feedback?

Colleagues and stakeholders are not real users. 

Analytic data. Diary studies. Remote live user testing. Studies. Qualitative, Contextual online conversation groups.

Asking questions, not measuring simple metrics.

Create a group for your own purposes, focus group.  

Good to still keep an academic tone while trying to appeal naturally to users.;

Are people crying out for a feature that nobody else is giving them?
Why aren’t people using your (or a competitor’s) product?
Lifestyles, attitudes of users? What other things they care about? Motivations/drivers?
What is the bigger context around their use of your product?

Where is you audience? Maybe not mobile?

Data is very accessible. Free/paid web and social media scraping tools. Tap into API of Twitter, scrape a specific forum. 

Begin with a hypothesis, use timeframes, volume changes, randomized samples… 

Ethics: Using public facing data. Commercial context.

Basing on trust
Biases (self and external)
Audiences lean younger

Don’t Make Me Think - Steve Krug
Nenography - Robert Kozinet

How to communicate with others your findings despite contention? 

Validating information with surveys. Being armed with data in addition to the human understanding. Showing your process to build trust. Talking early on, personable. Don’t be a “bad surprise”.

How to combine data types. Quantitative + qualitative data. Analysis. 

Using general speak to circumvent the release of internal information. 

Day 3: October 7, 2019, Monday

***Disclaimer*** I've decided to **not** punish myself by starting over every time I miss a few days, lol. Like, I get the general idea but sometimes life happens ya know? 

***Class Update*** I didn't get a point on an assignment. Canvas homework is designed in such a way that due dates are confusing. You get full credit for "turning in assignments x days early", which isn't very helpful when trying to keep track of everything. That said it was only one point and I'm still at like 99.xx%, I'm just a big baby about these things.

***Today's Progress*** I've spent a lot of the day working on improving my workstation. I've replaced Terminal with iterm2, installed oh my zsh & powerline, and customized some colors and things. I'll leave a link to a screenshot of what my terminal looks like now.

***Thoughts*** I ran into a few small errors that were easy to fix. I'll likely continue to work on coding stuff, particularly week two of my program (focusing heavily on HTML and CSS). I'll get into more of that tomorrow, while also recapping a tech meetup I'll be attending in Seattle.

Day 2: October 2, 2019, Wednesday

***Today's Progress*** I learned about the origins of the internet, and wrote a reflection on the motivation that Samuel F.B. Morse had to invent the telegraph and it's system of communication, morse code. I also created a basic HTML & CSS based webpage. 

***Thoughts*** I had difficulty at first due to a small typo that took me an hour to find. Once I found it, and created a second page just to play around, I felt the myspace wizard of yesteryear bursting through my fingertips.

**I booked a show for Ocotber 1, 2019, so there was no activity as I was busy.**

Day 1: September 30, 2019, Monday

Yes you read right, day one. I broke the rules. You can’t skip more than 1 day.

***Today’s Progress*** Reviewed basic git commands.

***Thoughts*** Since I last dabbled with #100daysofcode, I’ve begun a program at Seattle University. This should help me stay on track, and will give me some much needed structure to my educational endeavors.

Day 4: August 18, 2019, Sunday

***Today’s Progress*** Deployed a Rails app on heroku. This took me 5 hours because of stupid reasons. I did all the steps verbatim, and I kept getting an error during precompiling. I was determined to find a fix so I went in deep. If I wasn’t a google master before, I am definitely getting there now. 

***Thoughts*** The resolve was simply to uninstall the newest version of rails and install the prior version. This is a less-than-exciting result but it works so I’m not complaining.

***Today's Progress***: I have been spending the last few days practicing and learning the command line basics.

Day 2: August 13, 2019, Tuesday

***Today’s Progress***: Went to Seattle U for a presentation by The Creative Group about job readiness, things employers are looking for, that sort of thing. Went through a few more pages of The Odin Project, defining specifically what the internet is and how it functions.

***Thoughts*** I’d like to actually get to seeing some actual code! I’m grateful though for the resources available to me through the developer community. It’s almost overwhelming.

Day 1: August 11, 2019, Sunday

***Today’s Progress***: Re-familiarized myself with Terminal and VS Code. Set up my iPad as a second monitor for them. Cloned this repo from Github, I’m making changes now and I will be pushing them. I’ve watched and read tutorials on Git and VS Code. 

***Thoughts*** My goal is broadly to ‘get started’. I am going to go through TheOdinProject, which I’ve begun today. Today has been a re-introduction to some basics, such as navigating around the Terminal and getting VS Code installed. I read through the first three pages of The Odin Project and this was also a refresher, reminding me of study tips like the Pomodoro technique, and well as a reminder that this journey is not going to be easy. I am having orientation tomorrow with Seattle U’s advising for the web development certificate program I am starting in September, so this was a great all around refresher for me.
